It can lead to a false sense of security and feeds the idea that you can abuse your liver as much as you like and then sort everything else with a quick fix.\"It makes about as much sense as maxing out your credit cards and overdraft all year, then thinking you can fix it by just eating toast in January. The figures just don\\'t stack up.\"The British Liver Trust is launching a national awareness campaign for the month, which will see pop-up liver clinics offering health checks.The Love Your Liver roadshow will visit London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Exeter and Glasgow, and members of the public can have their livers tested for free.Andrew Langford, the trust\\'s chief executive, said: \"While people believe the hype and go on January detoxes to \\'rejuvenate\\' their liver, it would actually be more beneficial to adopt a more long-term attitude to achieving good liver health.\"People think they\\'re virtuous with their health by embarking on a liver detox each January with the belief that they are cleansing their liver of excess following the festive break.\"A one-hit, one-month attempt to achieve liver health is not the way to approach it.

Log inRecreational marijuana has gone on sale in California following the introduction of new legislation for 2018.\\xa0Local resident Jeff Deakin, 66, his wife Mary and their dog waited all night and were first in a line of 100 people when Harbourside dispensary, a longtime medical marijuana supplier\\xa0in Oakland, opened at 6am.It offered early customers joints for a penny and free T-shirts that read \"Flower to the People - Cannabis for All.\"\"It\\'s been so long since others and myself could walk into a place where you could feel safe and secure and be able to get something that was good without having to go to the back alley,\" said Mr Deakin.Customers began lining up before dawn outside Berkeley Patients Group, one of the oldest dispensaries in the US.Just after midnight, some raised joints instead of champagne glasses.Berkeley mayor Jesse Arreguin and state senator Nancy Skinner were on hand for a ribbon-cutting ceremony as his city began selling marijuana legally.California voters in 2016 made it legal for adults 21 and older to grow, possess and use limited quantities of marijuana, but it wasn\\'t legal to sell it for recreational purposes until Monday.Only about 90 businesses received state licenses to open on New Year\\'s Day. They are concentrated in San Diego, Santa Cruz, the San Francisco Bay Area and the Palm Springs area.Los Angeles and San Francisco are among the many cities where recreational pot will not be available right away because local regulations were not approved in time to start issuing city licenses needed for state permits.Meanwhile, Fresno, Bakersfield and Riverside are among the communities that have adopted laws forbidding recreational marijuana sales.LA officials announced last month that the city will not accept license applications until January 3, and it might take weeks before any licenses are issued.That led to widespread concern that long-established businesses would have to shut down during the interim.However, attorneys advising a group of city dispensaries said those businesses can keep legally selling medicinal marijuana as \"collectives,\" until they obtain local and state licenses under the new system, said\\xa0Jerred\\xa0Kiloh\\xa0of industry group the United Cannabis Business Association.State regulators said shops must have local and state licenses to open for business in the new year.But the city\\'s top pot regulator, Cat Packer, said last month that medicinal sales can continue to consumers with a doctor\\'s recommendation until new licenses are issued.As of Monday, 29 states have adopted medical marijuana laws.The next year is expected to be a bumpy one in California as more shops open and more stringent regulations take effect on the strains known as Sweet Skunk, Trainwreck and Russian Assassin.The California Police Chiefs Association, which opposed the 2016 ballot measure, remains concerned about stoned drivers, the risk to young people and the cost of policing the new rules in addition to an existing black market.At first, pot shops will be able to sell marijuana harvested without full regulatory controls.But eventually, the state will require extensive testing for potency, pesticides and other contaminants. A programme to track all pot from seed to sale will be phased in, along with other protections such as childproof containers.Jamie Garzot, founder of the 530 Cannabis shop in Northern California\\'s Shasta Lake, is concerned that when the current crop dries up, there will be a shortage of marijuana that meets state regulations.She said: \"California produces more cannabis than any state in the nation, but going forward, if it\\'s not from a state-licensed source, I can\\'t put it on my shelf. If I choose to do so, I run the risk of losing my license.\"Additional reporting by the Associated Press',\n",

Log inAnthony Martial and Jesse Lingard scored a goal apiece as Manchester United secured an important 2-0 win against Everton at Goodison Park.Jose Mourinho's United headed to Merseyside on New Year's Day off the back of three consecutive League draws, and looked uninspired in a drab first half as Sam Allardyce's defence stood firm.But United were a different animal after the interval, with Paul Pogba impressing in a more advanced role to set up Martial for the breakthrough after 57 minutes.The goal had been coming as United dominated Everton after half-time, and Martial's high finish past Jordan Pickford was the least Mourinho's men deserved as the Toffees wilted under pressure.Everton tried to stage a revival as the half wore on, but Pogba secured another assist as Lingard continued his impressive goalscoring form by bending the ball into the top corner of Pickford's net 10 minutes from time to seal the win.The victory ensured United went third in the table above Chelsea ahead of the champions' clash against Arsenal.It was Wayne Rooney, United's all-time record scorer, who lost the ball in the build-up to Martial's strike and the 32-year-old endured an evening to forget having been booked and taken off as the hosts lost control of the contest in the second period.Neither side could lay claim to dominance in the fragmented early stages, with both guilty of ponderous build-ups that missed end products.A loose Nemanja Matic pass in midfield - not the sole one in the opening period - led to an Everton break that required a sliding Marcos Rojo intervention to stop Oumar Niasse's shot.Rojo registered an effort on target with a 27th-minute header that was easy for Jordan Pickford before the Toffees stopper was forced into a more strenuous save when Martial fired across the six yard box.It came with the Frenchman familiarly cutting in off the left flank, yet as the lone striker he was not where his team needed him to be when Pickford pushed out.Life was injected into the contest within 75 seconds of the restart as Juan Mata forced Pickford into a fingertip save.The Spaniard pulled the trigger again from range with a swerving left-footed attempt that struck the outside of a post as United continued to increase the tempo.Martial nearly reached a Paul Pogba cross after the United skipper had coasted into the Toffees box via a one-two before the visitors got their reward, thanks to a helping hand from their former captain.Rooney lost possession on the edge of United's box and a counter led by Mata went through Pogba before Martial, who had dropped to the edge of the box, placed his shot into the corner..United were a different animal now and Sam Allardyce felt the need to stop the hosts being overrun in midfield, withdrawing Rooney, to a smattering of boos, and Yannick Bolasie just after the hour mark.It did not stop Pogba's growing influence and a fine Pickford save prevented him from rifling home a second before United's record buy nearly reached Martial's cross.For all the second half momentum, United's lead was still slender and the Goodison Park crowd was stirred by Niasse heading just wide.Yet the in-form Lingard put the game to bed, collecting a pass from Pogba, driving at Michael Keane and then curling around both Ashley Williams and Pickford for his 10th goal of the season.Additional reporting by the Press Association.\",\n",

A good win.\"I moved a bit more forwards in the second half and we did a good job.\"Both goals are lovely goals, the performance of the team was great, we could create more chances. If you don\\'t shoot you cannot score.\"We are United, if you draw it is a problem, we just want to win.\"',\n",

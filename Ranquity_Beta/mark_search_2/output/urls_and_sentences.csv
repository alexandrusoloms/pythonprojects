http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,It draws exclusively on data collected in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002 of the European Parliament and Council on waste statistics.
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"In 2014, the total waste generated in the EU-28 by all economic activities and households amounted to 2 503 million tonnes; this was the highest amount recorded for the EU-28 during the period 2004-2014 (a time series only exists for even years)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"In the EU-28, construction contributed 34.7 % of the total in 2014 and was followed by mining and quarrying (28.2 %), manufacturing (10.2 %), waste and water services (9.1 %) and households (8.3 %); the remaining 9.5 % was waste generated from other economic activities, mainly services (3.9 %) and energy (3.7 %)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"The high levels of waste generated in some of the smaller EU Member States can be clearly seen, with a particularly high value recorded for Bulgaria where on average 24.9 tonnes of waste were generated per inhabitant in 2014, five times the 4.9 tonnes per inhabitant average across the EU-28."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,Almost two thirds (64 % or 3.2 tonnes per inhabitant) of the total waste generated in the EU-28 in 2014 was major mineral wastes.
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"In general, those EU Member States that had higher shares of major mineral wastes were those that were characterised as having relatively sizeable mining and quarrying activities, such as Bulgaria, Sweden, Romania and Finland, and/or construction and demolition activities, such as Luxembourg; in these Member States, major mineral wastes accounted 85 % or more of all waste generated, as was also the case in Liechtenstein and Serbia."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"In the EU-28, 891 million tonnes of waste excluding major mineral wastes were generated in 2014, equivalent to 36 % of the total waste generated (Table 2)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"When expressed in relation to population size, the EU-28 generated, on average, 1.8 tonnes per inhabitant of waste excluding major mineral wastes in 2014 (Figure 3)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"While the overall level of waste excluding major mineral wastes fell 5.3 % between 2004 and 2014, the quantity per inhabitant fell by 8.0 % (as the EU’s population also grew over this period)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"Across the EU Member States, waste generation excluding major mineral wastes ranged, in 2014, from an average of 723 kg per inhabitant in Croatia to 9.5 tonnes per inhabitant in Estonia."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"In 2014, the highest levels of waste generation were recorded for water and waste services, for households and for manufacturing activities (208 million tonnes, 204 million tonnes and 184 million tonnes)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,Their developments followed different patterns over time: waste generation (excluding major mineral waste) by water and waste services increased by 87.7 % between 2004 and 2014.
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,The quantity of waste (excluding major mineral waste) generated from construction also grew at a rapid pace (rising by 57.2 % overall during the period under consideration).
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"Waste (excluding major mineral waste) generated by agriculture, forestry and fishing fell by 68.7 % and that from manufacturing activities by 32.2 %."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"Likewise, the quantity of waste (excluding major mineral waste) generated by mining and quarrying and by other sectors also diminished quite considerably, down by nearly a quarter (24.1 % and 22.7 % respectively)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"Among the waste generated in the EU-28 in 2014, some 95.0 million tonnes (3.8 % of the total) were classified as hazardous waste."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"Compared with 2010, 2.2 % more non-hazardous waste was generated in 2014 in the EU-28 and 2.8 % less hazardous waste, the latter decreasing in quantity terms from 97.8 to 95.0 million tonnes."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"In 2014, the share of hazardous waste in total waste generation was below 9.0 % in all of the EU Member States except for Estonia, where it made up a 47.7 % share of the total (see Figure 4)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"Among the non-member countries shown in Figure 4, Serbia recorded the highest share of hazardous waste in total waste generation (27.4 %) due to intensive activity in mining and quarrying, and was followed by Montenegro (24.4 %), Bosnia and Herzegovina (21.2 %, 2012 data) and Norway (11.7 %)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"In 2014, some 2 320 million tonnes of waste were treated in the EU-28 (see Table 3); this includes the treatment of waste imported into the EU and the reported amounts are therefore not directly comparable with those on waste generation."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,Nearly half (47.4 %) of the waste treated in the EU-28 in 2014 was disposed of other than through incineration (landfilling).
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,A further 36.2 % of the waste treated in the EU-28 in 2014 was sent to recovery operations other than energy recovery and backfilling (for simplification referred to as recycling).
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"Just over one tenth (10.2 %) of the waste treated in the EU-28 was backfilled, while the remainder was sent for incineration, either with energy recovery (4.7 %) or without (1.5 %)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,The quantity of waste subject to disposal in 2014 was 1.7 % lower than it had been in 2004; its share in total waste treatment fell from 54.6 % to 48.9 %.
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"The quantity of waste recovered, in other words incinerated with energy recovery, recycled or used for backfilling (the use of waste in excavated areas for the purpose of slope reclamation or safety or for engineering purposes in landscaping) grew by 23.4 % from 960 million tonnes in 2004 to 1 185 million tonnes in 2014; as a result, the share of such recovery in total waste treatment rose from 45.4 % in 2004 to 51.1 % by 2014."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"In total, 75.6 million tonnes of hazardous waste were treated in the EU-28 in 2014, with more than half of this treated in just three EU Member States, Germany (27.2 %), Bulgaria (16.1 %) and Estonia (13.6 %)(Figure 6)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"Nearly half (49.0 %) of the hazardous waste treated in the EU-28 was landfilled, in other words deposited into or onto land or through land treatment and release into water bodies, equivalent to 73 kg per inhabitant (Figure 7)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,Some 6.0 % of all hazardous waste was incinerated without energy recovery (9 kg per inhabitant) and a further 7.4 % with energy recovery (11 kg per inhabitant).
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics,"More than one third (37.5 %) of hazardous waste in the EU-28 was recovered (recycled or used for backfilling) in 2014, equivalent to 56 kg per inhabitant."

The CORINE Land Cover (CLC) inventory was initiated in 1985 (reference year 1990) to standardize data collection on land in Europe to support environmental policy development."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,It draws exclusively on data collected in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002 of the European Parliament and Council on waste statistics.
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"In 2014, the total waste generated in the EU-28 by all economic activities and households amounted to 2 503 million tonnes; this was the highest amount recorded for the EU-28 during the period 2004-2014 (a time series only exists for even years)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"In the EU-28, construction contributed 34.7 % of the total in 2014 and was followed by mining and quarrying (28.2 %), manufacturing (10.2 %), waste and water services (9.1 %) and households (8.3 %); the remaining 9.5 % was waste generated from other economic activities, mainly services (3.9 %) and energy (3.7 %)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"The high levels of waste generated in some of the smaller EU Member States can be clearly seen, with a particularly high value recorded for Bulgaria where on average 24.9 tonnes of waste were generated per inhabitant in 2014, five times the 4.9 tonnes per inhabitant average across the EU-28."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,Almost two thirds (64 % or 3.2 tonnes per inhabitant) of the total waste generated in the EU-28 in 2014 was major mineral wastes.
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"In general, those EU Member States that had higher shares of major mineral wastes were those that were characterised as having relatively sizeable mining and quarrying activities, such as Bulgaria, Sweden, Romania and Finland, and/or construction and demolition activities, such as Luxembourg; in these Member States, major mineral wastes accounted 85 % or more of all waste generated, as was also the case in Liechtenstein and Serbia."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"In the EU-28, 891 million tonnes of waste excluding major mineral wastes were generated in 2014, equivalent to 36 % of the total waste generated (Table 2)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"When expressed in relation to population size, the EU-28 generated, on average, 1.8 tonnes per inhabitant of waste excluding major mineral wastes in 2014 (Figure 3)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"While the overall level of waste excluding major mineral wastes fell 5.3 % between 2004 and 2014, the quantity per inhabitant fell by 8.0 % (as the EU’s population also grew over this period)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"Across the EU Member States, waste generation excluding major mineral wastes ranged, in 2014, from an average of 723 kg per inhabitant in Croatia to 9.5 tonnes per inhabitant in Estonia."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"In 2014, the highest levels of waste generation were recorded for water and waste services, for households and for manufacturing activities (208 million tonnes, 204 million tonnes and 184 million tonnes)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,Their developments followed different patterns over time: waste generation (excluding major mineral waste) by water and waste services increased by 87.7 % between 2004 and 2014.
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,The quantity of waste (excluding major mineral waste) generated from construction also grew at a rapid pace (rising by 57.2 % overall during the period under consideration).
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"Waste (excluding major mineral waste) generated by agriculture, forestry and fishing fell by 68.7 % and that from manufacturing activities by 32.2 %."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"Likewise, the quantity of waste (excluding major mineral waste) generated by mining and quarrying and by other sectors also diminished quite considerably, down by nearly a quarter (24.1 % and 22.7 % respectively)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"Among the waste generated in the EU-28 in 2014, some 95.0 million tonnes (3.8 % of the total) were classified as hazardous waste."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"Compared with 2010, 2.2 % more non-hazardous waste was generated in 2014 in the EU-28 and 2.8 % less hazardous waste, the latter decreasing in quantity terms from 97.8 to 95.0 million tonnes."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"In 2014, the share of hazardous waste in total waste generation was below 9.0 % in all of the EU Member States except for Estonia, where it made up a 47.7 % share of the total (see Figure 4)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"Among the non-member countries shown in Figure 4, Serbia recorded the highest share of hazardous waste in total waste generation (27.4 %) due to intensive activity in mining and quarrying, and was followed by Montenegro (24.4 %), Bosnia and Herzegovina (21.2 %, 2012 data) and Norway (11.7 %)."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"In 2014, some 2 320 million tonnes of waste were treated in the EU-28 (see Table 3); this includes the treatment of waste imported into the EU and the reported amounts are therefore not directly comparable with those on waste generation."
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,Nearly half (47.4 %) of the waste treated in the EU-28 in 2014 was disposed of other than through incineration (landfilling).

http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"Just over one tenth (10.2 %) of the waste treated in the EU-28 was backfilled, while the remainder was sent for incineration, either with energy recovery (4.7 %) or without (1.5 %)."

http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,Some 6.0 % of all hazardous waste was incinerated without energy recovery (9 kg per inhabitant) and a further 7.4 % with energy recovery (11 kg per inhabitant).
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics&oldid=373222,"More than one third (37.5 %) of hazardous waste in the EU-28 was recovered (recycled or used for backfilling) in 2014, equivalent to 56 kg per inhabitant."

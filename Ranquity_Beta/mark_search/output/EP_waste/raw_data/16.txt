the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report
by Simona BONAFÈ (S&D, IT) on the proposal for a directive
of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive
2008/98/EC on waste.The committee recommended that the European
Parliaments position adopted at first reading following the
ordinary legislative procedure should amend the Commission proposal
as follows:Members introduced amendments aiming to strengthen
waste prevention measures and encourage the development of an
efficient secondary raw materials market.They stressed that the Waste Framework Directive is an
important instrument to enhance the circular
economy.By-products: Members
stipulated that a substance or object resulting from a production
process the primary aim of which is not the production of that
substance or object shall be considered not to be waste, but to be
a by-product if certain conditions are met. They withheld the
possibility for the Commission to be empowered to establish
harmonised criteria on the application of by-product status,
prioritising proven and replicable industrial and agricultural
symbiosis practices.End-of-waste status: the
Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts establishing
harmonised provisions related to the end-of-waste status to certain
types of waste. Where criteria have not been set at a Union level,
Member States should be allowed to establish detailed end-of-waste
criteria at national level for certain waste in accordance with
conditions set at Union level.The weight of waste which is considered to have ceased
to be waste may be reported as recycled if the materials or
substances that have ceased to be waste are to be subject to
reprocessing, excluding energy recovery and the reprocessing into
materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling
operations.Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)
schemes: Members proposed introducing
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes and to define it
based on harmonised rules. Member States should ensure the
establishment of extended producer responsibility schemes for at
least packaging, electrical and electronic equipment, batteries and
accumulators, and end-of-life vehicles.Waste prevention: in
order to contribute to the prevention of waste, Member States shall
aim to achieve, at least, the following objectives:In order to achieve these objectives, Member States
shall in particular promote and support sustainable production and
consumption models; discourage the placing on the market of
products with planned obsolescence; reduce food losses along the
whole supply chain and prevent littering.By 31 December 2018, the Commission shall examine the
possibility of setting up Union-wide waste prevention targets to be
met by 2025 and 2030.Re-use: Members
suggested defining more clearly the notion of reuse. Re-use, should
be regarded as a specific waste prevention measure and incentivised
by the Member States.Preparation of re-use and recycling: Member States shall take ambitious measures in
respect of the preparing for re-use. They shall set up mandatory
separate collection of textiles by 2020 and take measures to
promote sorting systems for commercial and industrial waste for at
least the following: metals, plastics, paper and cardboard,
bio-waste, glass and wood.Members proposed that by 2030, the preparing
for re-use and the recycling of municipal waste shall be increased
to a minimum of 70 % by weight of municipal waste generated,
including a minimum of 5 % of total municipal waste prepared for
re-use. The Commission had proposed a target of 65 %.Member States which in 2013 recycled less than 20% of
their municipal waste may ask the Commission for an additional
five years in order to reach the preparation for re-use and
recycling targets set for 2025 and 2030.  To obtain these
exemptions, the Member States concerned should submit an
implementation plan, to be assessed by the Commission on the
basis of specific criteria, and should meet interim targets
relating to preparation for re-use and recycling.The Commission shall examine the possibility of
setting preparing for reuse and recycling targets that apply to
commercial waste, non-hazardous industrial waste and other waste
streams to be met by 2025 and 2030.Members also placed emphasis on the need for specific
measures for the reprocessing of organic waste and called for the
separate collection of bio-waste to be made mandatory and supported
with suitable economic instruments. Framework for the circular economy: no later than 31 December 2018, the Commission shall
draw up a report assessing the need for Union targets, particularly
for a Union resource efficiency target, as well as a report
identifying obstacles hampering the shift to a circular economy. It
should present a comprehensive review of Union eco-design
legislation.
